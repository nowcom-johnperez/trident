/**
 * <p>Deletes the Amazon EKS cluster control plane.</p>
 *         <p>If you have active services in your cluster that are associated with a load balancer,
 *             you must delete those services before deleting the cluster so that the load balancers
 *             are deleted properly. Otherwise, you can have orphaned resources in your VPC that
 *             prevent you from being able to delete the VPC. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/delete-cluster.html">Deleting a
 *                 Cluster</a> in the <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>If you have managed node groups or Fargate profiles attached to the cluster, you must
 *             delete them first. For more information, see <a>DeleteNodegroup</a> and <a>DeleteFargateProfile</a>.</p>
