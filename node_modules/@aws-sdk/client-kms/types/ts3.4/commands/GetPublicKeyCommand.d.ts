/**
 * <p>Returns the public key of an asymmetric CMK. Unlike the private key of a asymmetric CMK,
 *       which never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted, callers with <code>kms:GetPublicKey</code> permission
 *       can download the public key of an asymmetric CMK. You can share the public key to allow others
 *       to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of AWS KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within
 *       AWS KMS by calling the <a>Encrypt</a>, <a>ReEncrypt</a>, or <a>Verify</a> operations with the identifier of an asymmetric CMK. When you use the
 *       public key within AWS KMS, you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that
 *       are part of every AWS KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be
 *       decrypted. These features are not effective outside of AWS KMS. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations">Special Considerations
 *         for Downloading Public Keys</a>.</p>
 *          <p>To help you use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, <code>GetPublicKey</code> returns
 *       important information about the public key in the response, including:</p>

 *             <code>RSA_4096</code> or <code>ECC_NIST_P521</code>.</p>

 *          </ul>
 *          <p>Although AWS KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial
 *       that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly. For
 *       example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a
 *       public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by AWS KMS. You
 *       can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in a verification
 *       operation.</p>
 *          <p>The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For
 * details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">How Key State Affects Use
