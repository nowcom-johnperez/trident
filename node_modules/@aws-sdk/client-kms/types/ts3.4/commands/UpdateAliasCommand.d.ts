/**
 * <p>Associates an existing AWS KMS alias with a different customer master key (CMK). Each alias
 *       is associated with only one CMK at a time, although a CMK can have multiple aliases. The alias
 *       and the CMK must be in the same AWS account and region. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account. </p>
 *          <p>The current and new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric), and
 *       they must have the same key usage (<code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code> or <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>).
 *       This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must assign an alias to a
 *       different type of CMK, use <a>DeleteAlias</a> to delete the old alias and <a>CreateAlias</a> to create a new alias.</p>
 *          <p>You cannot use <code>UpdateAlias</code> to change an alias name. To change an alias name,
 *       use <a>DeleteAlias</a> to delete the old alias and <a>CreateAlias</a> to
 *       create a new alias.</p>
 *          <p>Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the
 *       aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from
 *       the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account,
 *       use the <a>ListAliases</a> operation. </p>
 *          <p>The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For
 * details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">How Key State Affects Use
 * of a Customer Master Key</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
